                    I am enthusiastic over humanity’s extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in
                    a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat that comes
                    along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best way to design a life
                    preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in
                    accepting yesterday’s fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only means for solving a given
                    problem. Our brains deal exclusively with special-case experiences. Only our minds are able to
                    discover the generalized principles operating without exception in each and every special-experience
                    case which if detected and mastered will give knowledgeable advantage in all instances.Because our
                    spontaneous initiative has been frustrated, too often inadvertently, in earliest childhood we do not
                    tend, customarily, to dare to think competently regarding our potentials. We find it socially easier
                    to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specialization’s and leave it to others---primarily to the
                    politicians---to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas. Countering that spontaneous grownup
                    trend to narrowness I will do my, hopefully "childish," best to confront

                    as many of our problems as possible by employing the longest-distance thinking of which I am capable
                    ---though that may not take us very far into the future.

                    Having been trained at the U. S. Naval Academy and practically experienced in the powerfully
                    effective forecasting arts of celestial navigation, pilotage, ballistics, and logistics, and in the
                    long-range, anticipatory, design science governing yesterday’s naval mastery of the world from which
                    our present day’s general systems theory has been derived, I recall that in 1927 I set about
                    deliberately exploring to see how far ahead we could make competent forecasts regarding the direction
                    in which all humanity is trending and to see how effectively we could interpret the physical details
                    of what comprehensive evolution might be portending as disclosed by the available data. I came to
                    the conclusion that it is possible to make a fairly reasonable forecast of about twenty-five years.
                    That seems to be about one industrial "tooling" generation. On the average, all inventions seem to
                    get melted up about every twenty-five years, after which the metals come back into recirculation in
                    new and usually more effective uses. At any rate, in 1927 I evolved a forecast. Most of my
