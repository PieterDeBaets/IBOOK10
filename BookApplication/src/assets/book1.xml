                    I am enthusiastic over humanity’s extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in
                    a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat that comes
                    along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best way to design a life
                    preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in
                    accepting yesterday’s fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only means for solving a given
                    problem. Our brains deal exclusively with special-case experiences. Only our minds are able to
                    discover the generalized principles operating without exception in each and every special-experience
                    case which if detected and mastered will give knowledgeable advantage in all instances.Because our
                    spontaneous initiative has been frustrated, too often inadvertently, in earliest childhood we do not
                    tend, customarily, to dare to think competently regarding our potentials. We find it socially easier
                    to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specialization’s and leave it to others---primarily to the
                    politicians---to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas. Countering that spontaneous grownup
                     trend to narrowness I will do my, hopefully "childish," best to confront

                    as many of our problems as possible by employing the longest-distance thinking of which I am capable
                    ---though that may not take us very far into the future.

                    Having been trained at the U. S. Naval Academy and practically experienced in the powerfully
                    effective forecasting arts of celestial navigation, pilotage, ballistics, and logistics, and in the
                    long-range, anticipatory, design science governing yesterday’s naval mastery of the world from which
                    our present day’s general systems theory has been derived, I recall that in 1927 I set about
                    deliberately exploring to see how far ahead we could make competent forecasts regarding the direction
                    in which all humanity is trending and to see how effectively we could interpret the physical details
                    of what comprehensive evolution might be portending as disclosed by the available data. I came to
                    the conclusion that it is possible to make a fairly reasonable forecast of about twenty-five years.
                    That seems to be about one industrial "tooling" generation. On the average, all inventions seem to
                    get melted up about every twenty-five years, after which the metals come back into recirculation in
                    new and usually more effective uses. At any rate, in 1927 I evolved a forecast. Most of my

                    1927’S prognosticating went only to 1952---that is, for a quarter-century, but some of it went on
                    for a half-century, to 1977.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1927 when people had occasion to ask me about my prognostications and I told them what I thought
                    it would be appropriate to do about what I could see ahead for the 1950’S, 1960’S, and 1970’s people
                    used to say to me, "Very amusing‹--you are a thousand years ahead of your time." Having myself
                    studied the increments in which we can think forwardly I was amazed at the ease with which the rest
                    of society seemed to be able to see a thousand years ahead while I could see only one-fortieth of
                    that time distance. As time went on people began to tell me that I was a hundred years ahead, and
                    now they tell me that I’m a little behind the times. But I have learned about public reaction to the
                    unfamiliar and also about the ease and speed with which the transformed reality becomes so "natural"
                    as misseemingly to have been always obvious. So I knew that their last observations were made only
                    because the evolutionary events I had foreseen have occurred on schedule.

                <p>
                    However, all that experience gives me confidence in discussing the next quarter-century’s events.
                    First, I’d like to explore a few thoughts about the vital data confronting us right now-such as the
                    fact that more than half of humanity as yet exists in miserable poverty, prematurely doomed, unless
                    we alter our comprehensive physical circumstances. It is certainly no solution to evict the poor,
                    replacing their squalid housing with much more expensive buildings which the original tenants can’t
                    afford to reoccupy. Our society adopts many such superficial palliatives. Because yesterday’s
                    negatives are moved out of sight from their familiar locations many persons are willing to pretend
                    to themselves that the problems have been solved. I feel that one of the reasons why we are
                    struggling inadequately today is that we reckon our costs on too shortsighted a basis and are later
                    overwhelmed with the unexpected costs brought about by our shortsightedness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, our failures are a consequence of many factors, but possibly one of the most important
                    is the fact that society operates on the theory that specialization is the key to success, not
                    realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking. This means that the
                    potentially-integratable-techno-economic advantages accruing to society from the

        <spread>
            <page style="text">
                <p>
                    myriad specializations are not comprehended integratively and therefore are not realized, or they
                    are realized only in negative ways, in new weaponry or the industrial support only of warfaring.
                    All universities have been progressively organized for ever finer specialization. Society assumes
                    that specialization is natural, inevitable, and desirable. Yet in observing a little child, we find
                    it is interested in everything and spontaneously apprehends, comprehends, and co-ordinates an ever
                    expending inventory of experiences. Children are enthusiastic planetarium audiences. Nothing seems
                    to be more prominent about human life than its wanting to understand all and put everything together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of humanity’s prime drives is to understand and be understood. All other living creatures are
                    designed for highly specialized tasks. Man seems unique as the comprehensive comprehender and
                    co-ordinator of local universe affairs. If the total scheme of nature required man to be a specialist
                    she would have made him so by having him born with one eye and a microscope attached to it.
                    What nature needed man to be was adaptive in many if not any direction; wherefore she gave man a
                    mind as well as a coordinating switchboard brain. Mind apprehends and comprehends the general
                    principles governing flight and deep

                    sea diving, and man puts on his wings or his lungs, then takes them off when not using them. The
                    specialist bird is greatly impeded by its wings when trying to walk. The fish cannot come out of the
                    sea and walk upon land, for birds and fish are specialists.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, we are beginning to learn a little in the behavioral sciences regarding how little we know
                    about children and the educational processes. We had assumed the child to be an empty brain receptacle
                    into which we could inject our methodically-gained wisdom until that child, too, became educated. In
                    the light of modern behavioral science experiments that was not a good working assumption.
                    Inasmuch as the new life always manifests comprehensive propensities I would like to know why it is
                    that we have disregarded all children’s significantly spontaneous and comprehensive curiosity and in
                    our formal education have deliberately instituted processes leading only to narrow specialization.
                    We do not have to go very far back in history for the answer. We get back to great, powerful men of
                    the sword, exploiting their prowess fortuitously and ambitiously, surrounded by the abysmal ignorance
                    of world society. We find early society struggling under

                    economic conditions wherein less than I per cent of humanity seemed able to live its full span of
                    years. This forlorn economic prospect resulted from the seeming inadequacy of vital resources and
                    from an illiterate society’s inability to cope successfully with the environment, while saddled also
                    with preconditioned instincts which inadvertently produced many new human babies. Amongst the
                    strugglers we had cunning leaders who said, "Follow me, and we’ll make out better than the others."
                    It was the most powerful and shrewd of these leaders who, as we shall see, invented and developed
                    specialization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking at the total historical pattern of man around the Earth and observing that three quarters
                    of the Earth is water, it seems obvious why men, unaware that they would some day contrive to fly
                    and penetrate the ocean in submarines, thought of themselves exclusively as pedestrians‹as dry land
                    specialists. Confined to the quarter of the Earth’s surface which is dry land it is easy to see how
                    they came to specialize further as farmers or hunters-or, commanded by their leader, became
                    specialized as soldiers. Less than half of the dry 25 per cent of the Earth’s surface was immediately
                    favorable to the support of human
                </p>
            </page>

            <page style="text">
                <p>
                    life. Thus, throughout history 99.9 per cent of humanity has occupied only 10 per cent of the total
                    Earth surface, dwelling only where life support was visibly obvious. The favorable land was not in
                    one piece, but consisted of a myriad of relatively small parcels widely dispersed over the surface
                    of the enormous Earth sphere. The small isolated groups of humanity were utterly unaware of one
                    another’s existence. They were everywhere ignorant of the vast variety of very different environments
                    and resource patterns occurring other than where they dwelt.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But there were a few human beings who gradually, through the process of invention and experiment,
                    built and operated, first, local river and bay, next, along-shore, then off-shore rafts, dugouts,
                    grass boats, and outrigger sailing canoes. Finally, they developed voluminous rib-bellied fishing
                    vessels, and thereby ventured out to sea for progressively longer periods. Developing ever larger
                    and more capable ships, the seafarers eventually were able to remain for months on the high seas.
                    Thus, these venturers came to live normally at sea. This led them inevitably into world-around,
                    swift, fortune-producing enterprise. Thus they became the first world men.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The men who were able to establish themselves on the oceans had also

                    to be extraordinarily effective with the sword upon both land and sea. They had also to have great
                    anticipatory vision, great ship designing capability, and original scientific conceptioning,
                    mathematical skill in navigation and exploration techniques for coping in fog, night, and storm
                    with the invisible hazards of rocks, shoals, and currents. The great sea venturers had to be able
                    to command all the people in their dry land realm in order to commandeer the adequate metalworking,
                    woodworking, weaving, and other skills necessary to produce their large, complex ships. They had to
                    establish and maintain their authority in order that they themselves and the craftsmen preoccupied
                    in producing the ship be adequately fed by the food-producing hunters and farmers of their realm.
                    Here we see the specialization being greatly amplified under the supreme authority of the
                    comprehensively visionary and brilliantly co-ordinated top swordsman, sea venturer. If his "ship
                    came in" ‹that is, returned safely from its years’ long venturing‹all the people in his realm
                    prospered and their leader’s power was vastly amplified.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There were very few of these top power men. But as they went on their sea ventures they gradually
                    found that the waters interconnected all the world’s people and
                </p>
            </page>

            <page style="text">
                <p>
                    lands. They learned this unbeknownst to their illiterate sailors, who, often as not, having been
                    hit over the head in a saloon and dragged aboard to wake up at sea, saw only a lot of water and,
                    without navigational knowledge, had no idea where they had traveled.
                    The sea masters soon found that the people in each of the different places visited knew nothing of
                    people in other places. The great venturers found the resources of Earth very unevenly distributed,
                    and discovered that by bringing together various resources occurring remotely from one another one
                    omplemented the other in producing tools, services, and consumables of high advantage and value.
                    Thus resources in one place which previously had seemed to be absolutely worthless suddenly became
                    highly valued. Enormous wealth was generated by what the sea venturers could do in the way of
                    integrating resources and distributing the products to the, everywhere around the world, amazed
                    and eager customers. The ship owning captains found that they could carry fantastically large
                    cargoes in their ships, due to nature’s floatability-cargoes so large they could not possibly be
                    carried on the backs of animals or the backs of men. Furthermore, the ships could sail across a

                    bay or sea, traveling shorter distances in much less time than it took to go around the shores
                    and over the intervening mountains. So these very few masters of the water world became incalculably
                    rich and powerful.

                    To understand the development of intellectual specialization, which is our first objective, we must
                    study further the comprehensive intellectual capabilities of the sea leaders in contradistinction to
                    the myriad of physical, muscle, and craft-skill specializations which their intellect and their
                    skillful swordplay commanded. The great sea venturers thought always in terms of the world, because
                    the world’s waters are continuous and cover three-quarters of the Earth planet. This meant that
                    before the invention and use of cables and wireless 99.9 per cent of humanity thought only in the
                    terms of their own local terrain. Despite our recently developed communications intimacy and popular
                    awareness of total Earth we, too, in 1969 are as yet politically organized entirely in the terms of
                    exclusive and utterly obsolete sovereign separateness.

                    This "sovereign--meaning top-weapons enforced‹"national" claim upon humans born in various lands
                    leads to ever more severely specialized servitude and highly personalized identity classification.

                    shall see, often meaningless questions "Where do you live?" "What are you?" "What religion?" "What
                    race?" ’"What nationality?" are all thought of today as logical questions. By the twenty-first
                    century it either will have become evident to humanity that these questions are absurd and
                    anti-evolutionary or men will no longer be living on Earth. If you don’t comprehend why that is so,
                    listen to me closely.

                      Obviously we need to pursue further the origins of specialization into deep history, hoping thereby
                      to correct or eliminate our erroneous concepts. Historically we can say that average human beings
                      throughout pre-twentieth-century history had each seen only about one-millionth of the surface of
                      their spherical Earth. This limited experience gave humans a locally-focused, specialized viewpoint.
                      Not surprisingly, humanity thought the world was flat, and not surprisingly humans thought its
                      horizontally extended plane went circularly outward to infinity. In our schools today we still
                      start off the education of our children by giving them planes and lines that go on,
                      incomprehensibly "forever" toward a meaningless infinity. Such oversimplified viewpoints are
                      misleading, blinding, and debilitating, because they preclude possible discovery of the
                      significance of our integrated experiences.Under these everyday, knowledge-thwarting or
                      limiting circumstances of humanity, the comprehensively-informed master venturers of history who
                      went to sea soon realized that the only real competition they had was that of other powerful
                      outlaws who might also know or hope to learn through experience "what it is all about." I call
                      these sea mastering people the great outlaws or Great Pirates-the G. P.’s‹ simply because the arbitrary laws enacted or edicted by men on the land

                     could not be extended effectively to control humans beyond their shores and out upon the seas. So
                     the world men who lived on the seas were inherently outlaws, and the only laws that could and did
                     rule them were the natural laws-the physical laws of universe which when tempestuous were often
                     cruelly devastating. High seas combined with nature’s fog and night-hidden rocks were uncompromising.

                    And it followed that these Great Pirates came into mortal battle with one another to see
                </p>
                <p>
                    who was going to control the vast sea routes and eventually the world. Their battles took place out
                    of sight of landed humanity. Most of the losers went to the bottom utterly unbeknownst to historians.
                    Those who stayed on the top of the waters and prospered did so because of their comprehensive
                    capability. That is they were the antithesis of specialists. They had high proficiency in dealing
                    with celestial navigation, the storms, the sea, the men, the ship, economics, biology, geography,
                    history, and science. The wider and more long distanced their anticipatory strategy, the more
                    successful they became.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But these hard, powerful, brilliantly resourceful sea masters had to sleep occasionally, and
                    therefore found it necessary to surround themselves with super-loyal,

                    muscular but dull-brained illiterates who could not see nor savvy their masters’ stratagems. There
                    was great safety in the mental dullness of these henchmen. The Great Pirates realized that the only
                    people who could possibly contrive to displace them were the truly bright people. For this reason
                    their number-one strategy was secrecy. If the other powerful pirates did not know where you were going,
                    nor when you had gone, nor when you were coming back, they would not know how to waylay you. If anyone
                    knew when you were coming home, "small-timers" could come out in small boats and waylay you in the
                    dark and take you over-just before you got home tiredly after a two-year treasure-harvesting voyage.
                    Thus hijacking and second-rate piracy became a popular activity around the world’s shores and harbors.
                    Thus secrecy became the essence of the lives of the successful pirates; ergo, how little is known
                    today of that which I am relating.

                    Leonardo da Vinci is the outstanding example of the comprehensively anticipatory design scientist.
                    Operating under the patronage of the Duke of Milan he designed the fortified defenses and weaponry
                    as well as the tools of peaceful production. Many other great military powers had

                    their comprehensive design scientist-artist inventors; Michelangelo was one of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many persons wonder why we do not have such men today. It is a mistake to think we cannot. What
                    happened at the time of Leonardo and Galileo was that mathematics was so improved by the advent of
                    the zero that not only was much more scientific shipbuilding made possible but also much more
                    reliable navigation. Immediately thereafter truly large-scale venturing on the world’s oceans
                    commenced, and the strong sword-leader patrons as admirals put their Leonardos to work, first in
                    designing their new and more powerful world-girdling ships. Next they took their Leonardos to sea
                    with them as their seagoing Merlins to invent ever more powerful tools and strategies on a
                    world-around basis to implement their great campaigns to best all the other great pirates, thereby
                    enabling them to become masters of the world and of all its people and wealth. The required and
                    scientifically designed secrecy of the sea operations thus pulled a curtain that hid the Leonardos
                    from public view, popular ken, and recorded history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the sea-dwelling Leonardos became Captains of the ships or even Admirals of Fleets, or
                    Commandants of the Navy yards where they designed

                    and built the fleets, or they became the commandants of the naval war colleges where they designed
                    and developed the comprehensive strategy for running the world for a century to come. This included
                    not only the designing of the network of world-around voyaging and of the ships for each task but
                    also the designing of the industrial establishments and world-around mining operations and naval
                    base-building for production and maintenance of the ships. This Leonardo-type planning inaugurated
                    today’s large-scale, world-around industrialization’s vast scale of thinking. When the Great Pirates
                    came to building steel steamships and blast furnaces and railroad tracks to handle the logistics,
                    the Leonardos appeared momentarily again in such men as Telford who built the railroads, tunnels,
                    and bridges of England, as well as the first great steamship.

                    the separate sovereignties’ internal democratic processes. As we soon shall see, the

                    British Isles lying off the coast of Europe constituted in effect a fleet of unsinkable ships and
                    naval bases commanding all the great harbours of Europe. Those islands were the possession of the
                    topmost Pirates. Since the Great Pirates were building, maintaining, supplying their ships on those
                    islands, they also logically made up their crews out of the native islanders who were simply seized
                    or commanded aboard by imperial edict. Seeing these British Islanders aboard the top pirate ships
                    the people around the world mistakenly assumed that the world conquest by the Great Pirates was a
                    conquest by the will, ambition, and organization of the British people. Thus was the G. P.’s grand
                    deception victorious. But the people of those islands never had the ambition to go out and conquer
                    the world. As a people they were manipulated by the top pirates and learned to cheer as they were told of their nation’s world prowess.

                    The topmost Great Pirates’ Leonardos discovered-both in their careful, long-distance planning and
                    in their anticipatory inventing‹that the grand strategies of sea power made it experimentally clear
                    that a plurality of ships could usually outmaneuver one ship. So the Great Pirates’ Leonardos
                    invented navies. Then, of

                    course, they had to control various resource-supplying mines, forests, and lands with which and
                    upon which to build the ships and establish the industries essential to building, supplying, and
                    maintaining their navy’s ships. Then came the grand strategy which said, "divide and conquer." You
                    divide up the other man’s ships in battle or you best him when several of his ships are hauled out
                    on the land for repairs. They also had a grand strategy of anticipatory divide and conquer.
                    Anticipatory divide and conquer was much more effective than tardy divide and conquer, since it
                    enabled those who employed it to surprise the other pirate under conditions unfavorable to the
                    latter, So the great top pirates of the world, realizing that dull people were innocuous and that
                    the only people who could contrive to displace the supreme pirates were the bright ones, set about
                    to apply their grand strategy of anticipatory divide and conquer to solve that situation comprehensively.

                    The Great Pirate came into each of the various lands where he either acquired or sold goods
                    profitably and picked the strongest man there to be his local head man. The Pirate’s picked man
                    became the Pirate’s general manager of the

                    local realm. If the Great Pirate’s local strong man in a given land had not already done so, the
                    Great Pirate told him to proclaim himself king. Despite the local head man’s secret subservience
                    to him, the Great Pirate allowed and counted upon his king-stooge to convince his countrymen that
                    he, the local king, was indeed the head man of all men ‹the god-ordained ruler. To guarantee that
                    sovereign claim the Pirates gave their stooge-kings secret lines of supplies which provided
                    everything required to enforce the sovereign claim. The more massively bejeweled the kings gold
                    crown, and the more visible his court and castle, the less visible was his pirate master.

                    The Great Pirates said to all their lieutenants around the world, "Any time bright young people
                    show up, I’d like to know about it, because we need bright men." So each time the Pirate came into
                    port the local king-ruler would mention that he had some bright, young men whose capabilities and
                    thinking shone out in the community. The Great Pirate would say to the king, "All right, you summon
                    them and deal with them as follows: As each young man is brought forward you say to him, ’Young

                    you study well and learn enough I’m going to make you my Royal Historian, but you’ve got to pass
                    many examinations by both your teacher and myself.’" And when the next bright boy was brought
                    before him the King was to say, "I’m going to make you my Royal Treasurer," and so forth. Then
                    the Pirate said to the king, "You will finally say to all of them: But each of you must mind your
                    own business or off go your heads. I’m the only one who minds everybody’s business.’ "

                    intellectual specialization. Of course, it took great wealth to start schools, to have great teachers,
                    and to house, clothe, feed, and cultivate both teachers and students. Only the Great-Pirate-protected
                    robber-barons and the Pirate-protected and secret intelligence-exploited international religious
                    organizations could afford such scholarship investment. And the development of the bright ones into

                    But specialization is in fact only a fancy form of slavery wherein the "expert" is fooled into
                    accepting his slavery by making him feel that in return he is in a socially and culturally preferred,
                    ergo, highly secure, lifelong position. But only the king’s son received the Kingdom-wide scope of

                    However, the big thinking in general of a spherical Earth and celestial navigation was retained
                    exclusively by the Great Pirates, in contradistinction to a four-cornered, flat world concept,
                    with empire and kingdom circumscribed knowledge, constricted to only that which could be learned
                    through localized preoccupations. Knowledge of the world and its resources was enjoyed exclusively
                    by the Great Pirates, as were also the arts of navigation, shipbuilding and handling, and of grand
                    logistical strategies and of nationally-undetectable,therefore effectively deceptive, international
                    exchange media and trade balancing tricks by which the top pirate, as (in gambler’s parlance)
                    "the house," always won.

                    Then there came a time, which was World War I, when the most powerful out-pirates challenged the
                    in-pirates with the scientific and technological innovation of an entirely new geometry of thinking.
                    The out-pirates attack went under and above the sea surface and into the invisible realm of
                    electronics and chemical warfaring. Caught off-guard, the in-pirates, in order to save themselves,
                    had to allow their scientists to go to work on their own inscrutable terms. Thus, in saving
                    themselves, the Great Pirates allowed the scientists to plunge their grand, industrial logistics,
                    support strategy into the vast ranges of the electro-magnetic spectrum that were utterly invisible
                    to the pirates.The pirates until then had ruled the world through their extraordinarily keen senses.
                    They judged things for themselves, and they didn’t trust anyone else’s eyes. They trusted only that
                    which they could personally smell, hear, touch, or see. But the Great Pirates couldn’t see what was
                    going on in the vast ranges of the electro-magnetic reality. Technology was going from wire to
                    wireless, from track to trackless, from pipe to pipeless, and from visible structural muscle to the
                    invisible chemical element strengths of metallic alloys and electro-magnetics.

                    frontiers of industry. The pirates delegated inspection to their "troubleshooter" experts, but had to content themselves with relayed second-hand information. This forced them to appraise blindly-ergo, only opinionatedly‹ whether this or that man really knew what he was talking about, for the G. P.’s couldn’t judge for themselves. Thus the Great Pirates were no longer the masters. That was the end. The Great Pirates became extinct. But because the G. P.’s had always operated secretly, and because they hoped they were not through, they of course did not announce or allow it to be announced that they were extinct. And because the public had never known of them and had been fooled into thinking of their kingly stooges and local politicians as being in reality the head men, society was and is as yet unaware either that the Great Pirates once ran the world or that they are now utterly extinct.

                    Abraham Lincoln’s concept of "right triumphing over might" was realized when Einstein as
                    metaphysical intellect wrote the equation of physical universe E = Mc2 and thus comprehended it.
                    Thus the metaphysical took the measure of, and mastered, the physical. That relationship seems by
                    experience to be irreversible. Nothing in our experience suggests that energy could comprehend and
                    write the equation of intellect. That equation is operating inexorably, and the metaphysical is
                    now manifesting its ability to reign over the physical.

                    The Great Pirates did run the world. They were the first and last to do so. They were world men,
                    and they ran the world with ruthless and brilliant pragmatism based on the mis-seemingly
                    "fundamental" information of their scientifically specialized servants. First came their Royal
                    Society scientific servants, with their "Great" Second Law of thermodynamics, whose "entropy"
                    showed that every energy machine kept losing energy and eventually "ran down." In their
                    pre-speed-of-light-measurement misconceptioning of an omnisimultaneous-instant universe"‹that
                    universe, as an energy machine was thought, also to be "running down." And thus the energy
                    wealth and life support were erroneously thought to be in continuous depletion-orginating the
                    misconception of "spending."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next came Thomas Malthus, professor of political economics of the Great Pirate’s East India
                    Company, who said that man was multiplying himself at a

                     geometrical rate and that food was multiplying only at an arithmetical rate. And lastly,
                     thirty-five years later, came the G. P.’s biological specialist servant, Charles Darwin, who,
                     explaining his theory of animate evolution, said that survival was only for the fittest.


                 </p>
                <p>
                    Quite clearly to the Great Pirates it was a scientific fact that not only was there not enough to
                    go around but apparently not enough to go around for even I per cent of humanity to live at a
                    satisfactorily-sustaining standard of living. And because of entropy the inadequacy would always
                    increase. Hence, said the G. P.’s, survival was obviously a cruel and almost hopeless battle. They
                    ran the world on the basis that these Malthusian-Darwinian entropy concepts were absolute scientific
                    laws, for that was what their scientifically respected, intellectual slave specialists had told them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we have the great pragmatic ideologist Marx running into that entropic-Malthusian-Darwinian
                    information and saying, "Well, the workers who produce things are the fittest because they are the
                    only ones who know how to physically produce and therefore they ought to be the ones to survive."
                    That was the beginning of the great "class warfare." All of the ideologies range somewhere between
                    the Great

                    Pirates and the Marxists. But all of them assume that there is not enough to go around. And that’s
                    been the rationalized working hypothesis of all the great sovereign claims to great areas of the
                    Earth. Because of their respective exclusivities, all the class warfare ideologies have become
                    extinct. Capitalism and socialism are mutually extinct. Why? Because science now finds there can
                    be ample for all, but only if the sovereign fences are completely removed. The basic
                    you-or-me-not-enough-for-both‹ergo, someone-must-die- tenets of the class warfaring are extinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let us examine more closely what we know scientifically about extinction. At the annual
                    Congress of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as held approximately ten
                    years ago in Philadelphia, two papers were presented in widely-separated parts of the Congress.
                    One was presented in anthropology and the other in biology, and though the two author-scientists
                    knew nothing of each other’s efforts they were closely related. The one in anthropology examined
                    the case histories of all the known human tribes that had become extinct. The biological paper
                    investigated the case histories of all the known biological species that had become extinct. Both
                    scientists sought for a common cause of extinction. Both of
                </p>

                    them found a cause, and when the two papers were accidentally brought together it was discovered
                    that the researchers had found the same causes. Extinction in both cases was the consequence of
                    over-specialization. How does that come about?

                    We can develop faster and faster running horses as specialists. To do so we inbreed by mating
                    two fast-running horses. By concentrating certain genes the probability of their dominance is
                    increased. But in doing so we breed out or sacrifice general adaptability. Inbreeding and
                    specialization always do away with general adaptability.

                    There’s a major pattern of energy in universe wherein the very large events, earthquakes,
                    and so forth, occur in any one area of universe very much less frequently than do the small
                    energy events. Around the Earth insects occur more often than do earthquakes. In the
                    patterning of total evolutionary events, there comes a time, once in a while, amongst the
                    myriad of low energy events, when a large energy event transpires and is so disturbing
                    that with their general adaptability lost, the ultra-specialized creatures perish. I will give you
                    a typical history-that of a type of bird which lived on a special variety of micro-marine life.
                    Flying around, these birds
                </p>
            </page>
            <page style="text">
                 <p>
                     gradually discovered that there were certain places in which that particular marine life tended
                     to pocket-in the marshes along certain ocean shores of certain lands. So, instead of flying
                     aimlessly for chance finding of that marine life they went to where it was concentrated in
                     bayside marshes. After a while, the water began to recede in the marshes, because the Earth’s
                     polar ice cap was beginning to increase. Only the birds with very long beaks could reach deeply
                     enough in the marsh holes to get at the marine life. The unfed, short-billed birds died off. This
                     left only the long-beakers. When the birds’ inborn drive to reproduce occurred there were only
                     other long-beakers surviving with whom to breed. This concentrated their long-beak genes. So, with
                     continually receding waters and generation to generation inbreeding, longer and longer beaked
                     birds were produced. The waters kept receding, and the beaks of successive generations of the
                     birds grew bigger and bigger. The long-beakers seemed to be prospering when all at once there was
                     a great fire in the marshes. It was discovered that because their beaks had become so heavy these
                     birds could no longer fly. They could not escape the flames by flying

                   out of the marsh. Waddling on their legs they were too slow to escape, and so they perished. This is
                   typical of the way in which extinction occurs‹through over-specialization.

                    When, as we have seen, the Great Pirates let their scientists have free rein in World War I the
                    Pirates themselves became so preoccupied with enormous wealth harvesting that they not only lost
                    track of what the scientists were doing within the vast invisible world but they inadvertently
                    abandoned their own comprehensivity and they, too, became severe specialists as industrial production
                    money makers, and thus they compounded their own acceleration to extinction in the world-paralyzing
                    economic crash of 1929. But society, as we have seen, never knew that the Great Pirates had been
                    running the world. Nor did society realize in 1929 that the Great Pirates had become extinct.
                    However, world’ society was fully and painfully aware of the economic paralysis. Society consisted
                    then, as now, almost entirely of specialized slaves in education, management, science, office
                    routines, craft, farming, pick-and-shovel labour, and their families. Our world society now has
                    none of the comprehensive and realistic world knowledge that the Great Pirates had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because world societies thought mistakenly of their local politicians,
                </p>
            </page>
            <page style="text">
                <p>
                    who were only the stooges of the Great Pirates, as being realistically the head men, society went
                    to them to get the industrial and economic machinery going again. Because industry is inherently
                    world-coordinate these world economic depression events of the 1920’S and 1930’S meant that each
                    of the local head politicians of a number of countries were asked separately to make the world work.
                    On this basis the world-around inventory of resources was no longer integratable. Each of the
                    political leaders’ mandates were given from different ideological groups, and their differing
                    viewpoints and resource difficulties led inevitably to World War II.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The politicians, having an automatic bias, were committed to defend and advantage only their own
                    side. Each assumed the validity of the Malthusian-Darwin-you-or-me-to-the-death struggle. Because
                    of the working concept that there was not enough to go around, the most aggressive political
                    leaders exercised their political leadership by heading their countries into war to overcome the
                    rest of the world, thus to dispose of the unsupportable excess population through decimation and
                    starvation-the age-old, lethal formula of ignorant men. Thus we had all our world society
                    specializing, whether under fascism, communism, or capitalism. All the great ideological groups
                    assumed Armageddon.

                    Getting ready for the assumed inexorable Armageddon, each applied science and all of the great
                    scientific specialization capabilities only toward weaponry, thus developing the ability to
                    destroy themselves totally with no comprehensively organized oppositional thinking capability
                    and initiative powerful enough to co-ordinate and prevent it. Thus by 1946, we were on the swift
                    way to extinction despite the inauguration of the United Nations, to which none of the exclusive
                    sovereign prerogatives were surrendered. Suddenly, all unrecognized as such by society, the
                    evolutionary antibody to the extinction of humanity through specialization appeared in the form
                    of the computer and its comprehensively commanded automation which made man obsolete as a physical
                    production and control specialist-and just in time.

                    The computer as superspecialist can persevere, day and night, day after day, in picking out the
                    pink from the blue at superhumanly sustainable speeds. The computer can also operate in degrees
                    of cold or heat at which man would perish. Man is going to be displaced altogether as a specialist
                    by the computer. Man himself is being forced to reestablish, employ, and enjoy his innate
                    "comprehensivlty." Coping with the totality of Spaceship Earth and universe is ahead for all of us.

                    Evolution consists of many great revolutionary events taking place quite independently of man’s
                    consciously attempting to bring them about. Man is very vain; he likes to feel that he is
                    responsible for all the favorable things that happen, and he is innocent of all the unfavorable
                    happenings. But all the larger evolutionary patternings seeming favorable or unfavorable to man’s
                    conditioned reflexing are transpiring transcendentally to any of man’s conscious planning or contriving.

                    deal that is automated regarding our total salvation on Earth, and I would like to get in that frame

                    Let us now exercise our intellectual faculties as best we can to apprehend the evolutionary
                    patternings transcending our spontaneous cognitions and recognitions. We may first note an
                    evolutionary trend that countered all of the educational systems and the deliberately increased
                    professional specialization of scientists. This contradiction occurred at the beginning of World
                    War II, when extraordinary new scientific instruments had been developed and the biologists and
                    chemists and physicists were meeting in Washington, D. C., on special war missions. Those scientists
                    began to realize that whereas a biologist used to think he was dealing only in cells and that a
                    chemist was dealing only in molecules and the physicist was dealing only in atoms, they now found
                    their new powerful instrumentation and contiguous operations overlapping. Each specialist suddenly
                    realized that he was concerned alike with atoms, molecules, and cells. They found there was no real
                    dividing line between their professional interests. They hadn’t meant to do this, but their
                    professional fields were being integrated ‹inadvertently, on their part, but apparently
                    purposefully-by inexorable evolution. So, as of World War II, the scientists began to invert
                    new professional designations: the bio-chemist, the bio-physicist, and
                </p>

                    so forth. They were forced to. Despite their deliberate attempts only to specialize, they were
                    being merged into ever more inclusive fields of consideration. Thus was deliberately specializing
                    man led back unwittingly once more to reemploy his innately comprehensive capabilities.

                    I find it very important in disembarrassing ourselves of our vanity, short-sightedness, biases, and
                    ignorance in general, in respect to universal evolution, to think in the following manner. I’ve
                    often heard people say, ’I wonder what it would be like to be on board a spaceship," and the answer
                    is very simple. What does it feel like? That’s all we have ever experienced. We are all astronauts.

                    I know you are paying attention, but I’m sure you don’t immediately agree and say, "Yes, that’s
                    right, I am an astronaut." I’m sure that you don’t really sense yourself to be aboard a
                    fantastically real spaceship‹our spherical Spaceship Earth. Of our little sphere you have seen
                    only small portions. However, you have viewed more than did pre-twentieth-century man, for in
                    his entire lifetime he saw only one-millionth of the Earth’s surface. You’ve seen a lot more.

                       Our little Spaceship Earth is only eight thousand miles in diameter, which is almost a negligible
                       dimension in the great vastness of space. Our nearest star‹our energy-supplying mother-ship, the
                       Sun‹is ninety-two million miles away, and the nearest star is one hundred thousand times further
                       away. It takes approximately four and one third years for light to get to us from the next
                       nearest energy supply ship star. That is the kind of space-distanced pattern we are flying.
                       Our little Spaceship Earth is right now travelling at sixty thousand miles an hour around the
                       around the sun and is also spinning axially, which, at the latitude of Washington, D. C., adds
                       approximately one thousand miles per hour to our motion. Each minute we both spin at one hundred
                       miles and zip in orbit at one thousand miles. That is a whole lot of spin and zip. When we launch
                       our rocketed space capsules at fifteen thousand miles an hour, that additional acceleration speed
                       we give the rocket to attain its own orbit around our speeding Spaceship Earth is only one-fourth
                       greater than the speed of our big planetary spaceship.Spaceship Earth was so extraordinarily well
                       invented and designed that to our knowledge

                    humans have been on board it for two million years not even knowing that they were on board a ship.
                    And our spaceship is so superbly designed as to be able to keep life regenerating on board despite
                    the phenomenon, entropy, by which all local physical systems lose energy. So we have to obtain our
                    biological life-regenerating energy from another spaceship‹the sun.

                    Our sun is flying in company with us, within the vast reaches of the Galactic system, at just the
                    right distance to give us enough radiation to keep us alive, yet not close enough to burn us up.
                    And the whole scheme of Spaceship Earth and its live passengers is so superbly designed that the
                    Van Allen belts, which we didn’t even know we had until yesterday, filter the sun and other star
                    radiation which as it impinges upon our spherical ramparts is so concentrated that if we went
                    nakedly outside the Van Allen belts it would kill us. Our Spaceship Earth’s designed infusion of
                    that radiant energy of the stars is processed in such a way that you and I can carry on safely.
                    You and I can go out and take a sunbath, but are unable

                    to take in enough energy through our skins to keep alive. So part of the invention of the Spaceship
                    Earth and its biological life-sustaining is that the vegetation on the land and the algae in the
                    sea, employing photosynthesis, are designed to impound the life-regenerating energy for us to
                    adequate amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But we can’t eat all the vegetation. As a matter of fact, we can eat very little of it. We can’t
                    eat the bark nor wood of the trees nor the grasses. But insects can eat these, and there are many
                    other animals and creatures that can. We get the energy relayed to us by taking the milk and meat
                    from the animals. The animals can eat the vegetation, and there are a few of the fruits and tender
                    vegetation petals and seeds that we can eat. We have learned to cultivate more of those botanical
                    edibles by genetical inbreeding.

                    That we are endowed with such intuitive and intellectual capabilities as that of discovering the
                    genes and the R.N.A. and D.N.A. and other fundamental principles governing the fundamental design
                    controls of life systems as well as of nuclear energy and chemical structuring is part of the

                   the Spaceship Earth, its equipment, passengers, and internal support systems. It is therefore
                   paradoxical but strategically explicable, as we shall see, that up to now we have been mis-using,
                   abusing, and polluting this extraordinary chemical energy-interchanging system for successfully
                   regenerating all life aboard our planetary spaceship.
               </p>
                <p>
                    One of the interesting things to me about our spaceship is that it is a mechanical vehicle, just
                    as is an automobile. If you own an automobile, you realize that you must put oil and gas into it,
                    and you must put water in the radiator and take care of the car as a whole. You begin to develop
                    quite a little thermodynamic sense. You know that you’re either going to have to keep the machine
                    in good order or it’s going to be in trouble and fail to function. We have not been seeing our
                    Spaceship Earth as an integrally-designed machine which to be persistently successful must be
                    comprehended and serviced in total.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now there is one outstandingly important fact regarding Spaceship Earth, and that is that no
                    instruction book came with it. I think it’s very significant that there is no instruction book
                    for successfully operating our ship. In view of the

                <p>
                    infinite attention to all other details displayed by our ship, it must be taken as deliberate and
                    purposeful that an instruction book was omitted. Lack of instruction has forced us to find that
                    there are two kinds of berries-red berries that will kill us and red berries that will nourish us.
                    And we had to find out ways of telling which-was-which red berry before we ate it or otherwise we
                    would die. So we were forced, because of a lack of an instruction book, to use our intellect, which
                    is our supreme faculty, to devise scientific experimental procedures and to interpret effectively
                    the significance of the experimental findings. Thus, because the instruction manual was missing we
                    are learning how we safely can anticipate the consequences of an increasing number of alternative
                    ways of extending our satisfactory survival and growth-both physical and metaphysical.

                    Quite clearly, all of life as designed and born is utterly helpless at the moment of birth. The
                    human child stays helpless longer than does the young of any other species. Apparently it is part
                    of the invention "man" that he is meant to be utterly helpless through certain anthropological
                    phases and that, when he begins to be

                    able to get on a little better, he is meant to discover some of the physical leverage-multiplying
                    principles inherent in universe as well as the many nonobvious resources around him which will
                    further compoundingly multiply his knowledge-regenerating and life-fostering advantages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would say that designed into this Spaceship Earth’s total wealth was a big safety factor which
                    allowed man to be very ignorant for a long time until he had amassed enough experiences from which
                    to extract progressively the system of generalized principles governing the increases of energy
                    managing advantages over environment. The designed omission of the instruction book on how to
                    operate and maintain Spaceship Earth and its complex life-supporting and regenerating systems has
                    forced man to discover retrospectively just what his most important forward capabilities are. His
                    intellect had to discover itself. Intellect in turn had to compound the facts of his experience.
                    Comprehensive reviews of the compounded facts of experiences by intellect brought forth awareness
                    of the generalized principles underlying all special and only superficially-sensed experiences.
                    Objective employment of those generalized principles in rearranging the physical resources of
                    environment seems to be leading to humanity’s eventually total success and readiness to cope with
                    far vaster problems of universe.

                    To comprehend this total scheme we note that long ago a man went through the woods, as you may have
                    done, and I certainly have, trying to find the shortest way through the woods in a given direction.
                    He found trees fallen across his path. He climbed over those crisscrossed trees and suddenly found
                    himself poised on a tree that was slowly teetering. It happened to be lying across another great
                    tree, and the other end of the tree on which he found himself teetering lay under a third great
                    fallen tree. As he teetered he saw the third big tree lifting. It seemed impossible to him. He went
                    over and tried using his own muscles to lift that great tree. He couldn’t budge it. Then he climbed
                    back atop the first smaller tree, purposefully teetering it, and surely enough it again elevated
                    the larger tree. I’m certain that the first man who found such a tree thought that it was a magic
                    tree, and may have dragged it home and erected it as man’s first totem. It was probably a long
                    time before he learned that any stout tree would do, and thus extracted the concept of the

                    generalized principle of leverage out of all his earlier successive special-case experiences with
                    such accidental discoveries. Only as he learned to generalize fundamental principles of physical
                    universe did man learn to use his intellect effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once man comprehended that any tree would serve as a lever his intellectual advantages accelerated.
                    Man freed of special-case superstition by intellect has had his survival potentials multiplied
                    millions fold. By virtue of the leverage principles in gears, pulleys, transistors, and so forth,
                    it is literally possible to do more with less in a multitude of physio-chemical ways. Possibly it
                    was this intellectual augmentation of humanity’s survival and success through the metaphysical
                    perception of generalized principles which may be objectively employed that Christ was trying to
                    teach in the obscurely told story of the loaves and the fishes.

                    How may we use our intellectual capability to higher advantage? Our muscle is very meager as
                    compared to the muscles of many animals. Our integral muscles are as nothing compared to the power
                    of a tornado or the atom bomb which society contrived-in fear-out of the intellect’s fearless
                    discoveries of generalized principles governing the fundamental energy behaviors of physical
                    universe.In organizing our grand strategy we must first discover where we are now; that is, what
                    our present navigational position in the universal scheme of evolution is. To begin our
                    position-fixing aboard our Spaceship Earth we must first acknowledge that the abundance of
                    immediately consumable, obviously desirable or utterly essential resources have been sufficient
                    until now to allow us to carry on despite our ignorance. Being eventually exhaustible and spoilable,
                    they have been adequate only up to this critical moment. This cushion-for-error of humanity’s
                    survival and growth up to now was apparently provided just as a bird inside of the egg is provided
                    with liquid nutriment to develop it to a certain point. But then by design the nutriment is
                    exhausted at just the time when the chick is large enough to be able to locomote on its own legs.

                    so as the chick pecks at the shell seeking more nutriment it inadvertently breaks open the shell.
                    Stepping forth from its initial sanctuary, the young bird must now forage on its own legs and wings
                    to discover the next phase of its regenerative sustenance.

                    My own picture of humanity today finds us just about to step out from amongst the pieces of our just
                    one-second-ago broken eggshell. Our innocent, trial-and-error-sustaining nutriment is exhausted. We
                    are faced with an entirely new relationship to the universe. We are going to have to spread our
                    wings of intellect and fly or perish; that is, we must dare immediately to fly by the generalized
                    principles governing universe and not by the ground rules of yesterday’s superstitious and
                    erroneously conditioned reflexes. And as we attempt competent thinking we immediately begin to
                    reemploy our innate drive for comprehensive understanding.

                    The architects and planners, particularly the planners, though rated as specialists, have a little
                    wider focus than do the other professions. Also as human beings they often battle the narrow views
                    of specialists-in particular, their patrons-the politicians, and the financial and other legal, but
                    no longer comprehensively effective, heirs to the great pirates’-now only ghostly‹prerogatives.

                      the planners are allowed to look at all of Philadelphia, and not just to peek through a hole at
                      one house or through one door at one room in that house. So I think it’s appropriate that we
                      assume the role of planners and begin to do the largest scale comprehensive thinking of which we
                      are capable.

                    We begin by eschewing the role of specialists who deal only in parts. Becoming deliberately
                    expansive instead of contractive, we ask, "How do we think in terms of wholes?" If it is true that
                    the bigger the thinking becomes the more lastingly effective it is, we must ask, "How big can we
                    think?"

                    One of the modern tools of high intellectual advantage is the development of what is called general
                    systems theory. Employing it we begin to think of the largest and most comprehensive systems, and
                    try to do so scientifically. We start by inventorying all the important, known variables that are
                    operative in the problem. But if we don’t really know how big "big" is, we may not start big enough,
                    and are thus likely to leave unknown, but critical, variables outside the system which will continue
                    to plague us. Interaction of

                    the unknown variables inside and outside the arbitrarily chosen limits of the system are probably
                    going to generate misleading or outrightly wrong answers. If we are to be effective, we are going
                    to have to think in both the biggest and most minutely-incisive ways permitted by intellect and by
                    the information thus far won through experience.

                    Can we think of, and state adequately and incisively, what we mean by universe? For universe is,
                    inferentially, the biggest system. If we could start with universe, we would automatically avoid
                    leaving out any strategically critical variables. We find no record as yet of man having
                    successfully defined the universe-scientifically and comprehensively-to include the nonsimultaneous
                    and only partially overlapping, micro-macro, always and everywhere transforming, physical and
                    metaphysical, omni-complementary but nonidentical events.

                    Man has failed thus far, as a specialist, to define the microcosmic limits of divisibility of the
                    nucleus of the atom, but, epochally, as accomplished by Einstein, has been able to define
                    successfully the physical universe but not the metaphysical universe; nor has he, as yet, defined
                    total universe itself as combining both the physical and metaphysical. The scientist was able to

                    can neither be created nor lost and, therefore, that energy is conserved and is therefore finite.

                    Einstein successfully equated the physical universe as E = Mc2. His definition was only a
                    hypothetical venture until fission proved it to be true. The physical universe of associative
                    and disassociative energy was found to be a closed, but nonsimultaneously occurring, system-its
                    separately occurring events being mathematically measurable; i.e., weighable and equatable. But
                    the finite physical universe did not include the metaphysical weightless experiences of universe.
                    All the unweighables, such as any and all our thoughts and all the abstract mathematics, are
                    weightless. The metaphysical aspects of universe have been thought by the physical scientists to
                    defy "closed system’s" analysis. I have found, however, as we shall soon witness, that total
                    universe including both its physical and metaphysical behaviors and aspects are scientifically definable.

                    Einstein and others have spoken exclusively about the physical department of universe in words
                    which may be integrated and digested as the aggregate of nonsimultaneous and only partially
                    overlapping, nonidentical, but always complementary, omni-transforming, and weighable energy
                    events. Eddington defines science as "the earnest attempt to set in order the facts of experience."

                    Holding to the scientists’ experiences as all important, I define universe, including both the
                    physical and metaphysical, as follows: The universe is the aggregate of all of humanity’s
                    consciously-apprehended and communicated experience with the nonsimultaneous, nonidentical, and
                    only partially overlapping, always complementary, weighable and unweighable, ever omni-transforming,
                    event sequences.

                    Each experience begins and ends-ergo, is finite. Because our apprehending is packaged, both
                    physically and metaphysically, into time increments of alternate awakeness and asleepness as well
                    as into separate finite conceptions such as the discrete energy quanta and the atomic nucleus
                    components of the fundamental physical discontinuity, all experiences are finite. Physical
                    experiments have found no solids, no continuous surfaces or lines‹only discontinuous constellations
                    of individual events. An aggregate of finites is finite. Therefore, universe as experientially
                    defined, including both the physical and metaphysical, is finite.

                    of General Systems Analysis that proceeds from here. It is played somewhat like the game of

                    Having adequately defined the whole system we may proceed to subdivide progressively. This is
                    accomplished through progressive division into two parts‹one of which, by definition, could not
                    contain the answer-and discarding of the sterile part. Each progressively-retained live part is
                    called a "bit" because of its being produced by the progressive binary "yes" or "no" bi-section of
                    the previously residual live part. The magnitude of such weeding operations is determined by the
                    number of successive bits necessary to isolate the answer.

                    How many "bi-secting bits" does it take to get rid of all the irrelevancies and leave in lucid
                    isolation that specific information you are seeking? We find that the first subdividing of the
                    concept of universe-bit one‹is into what we call a system. A system subdivides universe into all
                    the universe outside the system (macrocosm) and all the rest of the universe which is inside the
                    system (microcosm) with the exception of the minor fraction of universe which constitutes the system

                     itself. The system divides universe not only into macrocosm and microcosm but also coincidentally
                     into typical conceptual and nonconceptual aspects of universe-that is, an overlappingly-associable
                     consideration, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, all the nonassociable,
                     nonoverlappingly-considerable, nonsimultaneously-transforming events of nonsynchronizable disparate
                     wave frequency rate ranges.

                    A thought is a system, and is inherently conceptual-though often only dimly and confusedly
                    conceptual at the moment of first awareness of the as yet only vaguely describable thinking activity.
                    Because total universe is nonsimultaneous it is not conceptual. Conceptuality is produced by isolation,
                    such as in the instance of one single, static picture held out from a moving-picture film’s continuity,
                    or scenario. Universe is an evolutionary-process scenario without beginning or end, because the shown
                    part is continually transformed chemically into fresh film and reexposed to the ever self-reorganizing
                    process of latest thought realizations which must continually introduce new significance into the
                    freshly written description of the ever-transforming events before splicing the film in again for its

                    A great circle is a line formed on a sphere’s surface by a plane going through the sphere’s
                    centre. Lesser circles are formed on the surfaces of spheres by planes cutting through spheres
                    but not passing through the sphere’s centre. When a lesser circle is superimposed on a great
                    circle it cuts across the latter at two points, A and B. It is a shorter distance between A and B

                    Thinking itself consists of self-disciplined dismissal of both the macrocosmic and microcosmic
                    irrelevancies which leaves only the lucidly-relevant considerations. The macrocosmic irrelevancies
                    are all the events too large and too infrequent to be synchronizably tuneable in any possible
                    way with our consideration (a beautiful word meaning putting stars together). The microcosmic
                    irrelevancies are all the events which are obviously too small and too frequent to be differentially
                    resolved in any way or to be synchronizably-tuneable within the lucidly-relevant wave-frequency
                    limits of the system we are considering.

                    all the "star" identities in the constellation under consideration? The answer is the formula

                    "synergetics"-which word I will define while clarifying its use. By questioning many audiences,
                    I have discovered that only about one in three hundred are familiar with synergy. The word is
                    obviously not a popular word. Synergy is the only word in our language that means behavior of
                    whole systems unpredicted by the separately observed behaviors of any of the system’s separate
                    parts or any subassembly of the system’s parts. There is nothing in the chemistry of a toenail
                    that predicts the existence of a human being.

                    50 per cent stronger than the sum of the strengths of all its links. We think popularly only
                    in the terms of a chain being no stronger than its weakest link, which concept fails to consider,
                    for instance, the case of an endlessly interlinked chain of atomically self-renewing links of
                    omni-equal strength or of an omni-directionally interlinked chain matrix of ever renewed atomic
                    links in which one broken link would be, only momentarily, a local cavern within the whole mass
                    having no weakening effect on the whole, for every link within the matrix is a high frequency,
                    recurring, break-and-make restructuring of the system.

                    Since synergy is the only word in our language meaning behavior of wholes unpredicted by behavior
                    of their parts, it is clear that society does not think there are behaviors of whole systems
                    unpredicted by their separate parts. This means that society’s formally-accredited thoughts and
                    ways of accrediting others are grossly inadequate in comprehending the nonconceptual qualities

                    of all mammals aboard Spaceship Earth, and nothing about the mammals that predicts that the
                    gases which they give off respiratorily are essential to the support of the vegetation aboard

                    There is a corollary of synergy which says that the known behavior of the whole and the known

                    remaining parts as does the known sum of the angles of a triangle plus the known behavior of
                    three of its six parts make possible evaluating the others. Topology provides the synergetic

                <p>
                    Topology is the science of fundamental pattern and structural relationships of event constellations.
                    It was discovered and developed by the mathematician Euler. He discovered that all patterns can be
                    reduced to three prime conceptual characteristics: to lines; points where two lines cross or the same
                    line crosses itself; and areas, bound by lines. He found that there is a constant relative abundance
                    of these three fundamentally unique and no further reducible aspects of all patterning

                <p>
                    This reads: the number of points plus the number of areas always equals the number of lines plus

                <p>The first census of population in the United States was taken in 1790. In I8IO the United States Treasury conducted the first economic census of the young democracy. There were at that time one million families in this country. There were also one million human slaves. This did not mean that each family had a human slave; far from it. The slaves were owned by relatively few. The Treasury adjudged the monetary value of the average American homestead, lands, buildings, furnishings, and tools to be worth sum-totaIly $350 per family. The Treasury appraised the average worth of each slave as $400. It was estimated that the wilderness hinterlands of America were worth $1,500 per family. The foregoing assets plus the canals and toll roads brought the equity of each family to a total of $3,000. This made the national wealth of the United States, as recognized by man, worth three billion dollars.
                </p>
                <p>    Let us assume that, practicing supreme wisdom, the united American citizens of I8IO had convened their most reliably esteemed and farsighted leaders and had asked them to undertake a 150-year, grand economic and technical plan for most effectively and swiftly developing America’s and the world’s life-support system-to be</p>

Railroads were as yet undreamed of, let alone wireless, X-ray, electric light, power by wire and electric motors. There was no conception of the periodic table of the atoms or of the existence of an electron. Had any of our forefathers committed our wealth of I8IO toward bouncing radar impulses off the Moon he would have been placed in a lunatic asylum.</p>
                <p>Under those I8IO circumstances of an assumed capital wealth of the united American states, both public and private, amounting to only three billion dollars, it is preposterous to think of humanity’s most brilliant and powerful leaders electing to invest their "all" of three billion dollars in a "thousand times more expensive" ten-trillion-dollar adventure such, however, as has since transpired, but only under the war-enforced threat of disintegration of the meager rights won thus far by common man from history-long tyrannical powers of a techno-illiterate and often cruel few.</p>

Assuming a 10 per cent rate of earnings, this 1970 trillion-dollar product would mean that a capital base of ten trillion dollars was operative within the United States alone where the 18IO national leaders had accredited only three billion dollars of national assets. The wisest humans recognized in I8IO only one three-hundredth of I per cent of the immediately thereafter "proven value" of the United States’ share of the world’s wealth-generating potentials. Of course, those wisest men of the times would have seen little they could afford to do.</p>
                <p>Our most reliable, visionary, and well-informed great-grandfathers of I8IO could not have foreseen that in the meager century and one-half of all the billionsfold greater reaches of known universal time that human life-span would be trebled, that the yearly real income of the individual would be "enfolded, that the majority of diseases would be banished, and human freedom of realized travel one-hundred-folded; that humans would be able to whisper effortlessly in one another’s ear from anywhere around the world apart and at a speed of </p>

Because they are gestating invisibly it is approximately impossible for world society to comprehend that the changes in the next thirty-five years-ushering in the twenty-first century-will be far greater than in our just completed century and one-half since the first United States economic census. We are engulfed in an invisible tidal wave which, as it draws away, will leave humanity, if it survives, cast up upon an island of universal success uncomprehending how it has all happened.</p>
                <p>But we can scientifically assume that by the twenty-first century either humanity will not be living aboard Spaceship Earth or, if approximately our present numbers as yet remain aboard, that humanity then will have recognized and organized itself to realize effectively the fact that humanity can afford to do anything </p>

Humans will be free in the sense that 99.9 per cent of their waking hours will be freely investable at their own discretion.

How can India develop a favorable trade balance under those circumstances? If it can’t have a workable, let alone favorable balance, how can these half-billion people participate in world intercourse? Millions of Hindus have never heard of America, let alone the international monetary system. Said Kipling "East is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet."</p>
                <p>As a consequence of the Great Pirates’ robbing Indo-China for centuries and cashing in their booty in Europe, so abysmally impoverished, underfed and physically afflicted have India’s and Ceylon’s billions of humans been throughout so many centuries that it is their religious belief that life on Earth is meant to be exclusively a hellish trial and that the worse the conditions encountered by the individual the quicker his entry into heaven.

All this because they have had no other way to explain life’s hopelessness. On the other hand, they are extremely capable thinkers, and free intercourse with the world could change their views and fate. It is paradoxical that India’s population should starve as one beef cattle for every three people wander through India’s streets, blocking traffic as sacred symbols of nonsense. Probably some earlier conquerors intent to reserve the animals for their exclusive consumption as did later the kings of European nations decreed that God had informed the king that he alone was to eat animal meat and therefore God forbade the common people under penalty of death from killing a beef cattle for their own consumption.</p>
                <p>One of the myths of the moment suggest that wealth comes from individual bankers and capitalists. This concept is manifest in the myriad of charities that have to beg for alms for the poor, disabled, and helpless young and old in general. These charities are a hold-over from the old pirate days, when it was thought that</p>

                <p>there would never be enough to go around. They also are necessitated by our working assumption that we cannot afford to take care of all the helpless ones. Counseled by our bankers, our politicians say we can’t afford the warring and the great society, too. And because of the mythical concept that the wealth which is disbursed is coming from some magically-secret private source, no free and healthy individual wants that "hand out" from the other man, whoever he may be. Nor does the individual wish to be on the publicly degrading "dole" line.</p>
                <p>After World War II several million of our well-trained, healthiest young people came suddenly out of the military service. Because we had automated during the war to a very considerable degree to meet the "war challenges" there were but few jobs to offer them. Our society could not say realistically that the millions of their healthiest, best informed young were unfit because they couldn’t get a job, which had until that historical moment been the criteria of demonstrated fitness in Darwin’s "survival only of the fittest" struggle. In that emergency we legislated the GI Bill and sent them all to schools, colleges, and universities. This act</p>
            </page>
            <page style="text">
                <p>was politically rationalized as a humanly dignified fellowship reward of their war service and not as a "hand out." It produced billions of dollars of new wealth through the increased know-how and intelligence thus released, which synergetically augmented the spontaneous initiative of that younger generation. In legislating this "reckless spending" of wealth we didn’t know that we had produced a synergetic condition that would and did open the greatest prosperity humanity has ever known.</p>
                <p>Through all pre-twentieth century history wars were devastating to both winners and losers. The pre-industrial wars took the men from the fields, and the fields where the exclusively agricultural-wealth germinated, were devastated. It came as a complete surprise, therefore, that the first World War, which was the first full-fledged industrial-era war, ended with the United States in particular but Germany, England, France, Belgium, Italy, Japan, and Russia in lesser degree all coming out of the war with much greater industrial production capabilities than those with which they had entered. That wealth was soon misguidedly invested in the second World War, from which all the industrial countries emerged with even greater wealth producing capabilities, despite the superficial knockdown of the already obsolete buildings. It was irrefutably proven</p>

            <page style="text">
                <p>that the destruction of the buildings by bombing, shell fire, and flames left the machinery almost unharmed. The productive tooling capabilities multiplied unchecked, as did their value.</p>
                <p>This unexpected increase in wealth by industrial world wars was caused by several facts, but most prominently by the fact that in the progressive acquisition of instruments and tools which produce the even more effective complex of industrial tools, the number of special purpose tools that made the end-product armaments and ammunition was negligible in comparison with the redirectable productivity of the majority of the general-purpose tools that constituted the synergistic tool complex. Second, the wars destroyed the obsolete tool-enclosing brick-and-wood structures whose factual availability, despite their obsolescence, had persuaded their owners to over extend the structures’ usefulness and exploitability. This drive to keep milking the old proven cow not risking the production of new cows had blocked the acquisition of up-to-date tools. Third, there was the synergetic surprise of alternative or "substitute" technologies which were developed to bypass destroyed facilities. The latter often proved to be more efficient than the tools that were destroyed. Fourth, the metals themselves not only were not destroyed but were acceleratingly reinvested in new, vastly higher-performance</p>
            </page>
            <page style="text">
                <p>per pound tools. It was thus that the world war losers such as Germany and Japan became overnight the postwar industrial winners. Their success documented the fallacy of the whole economic evaluation system now extant.</p>
                <p>Thus again we see that, through gradually increasing use of his intuition and intellect, man has discovered many of the generalized principles that are operative in the universe and has employed them objectively but separately in extending his internal metabolic regeneration by his invented and detached tool extensions and their remote operation affected by harnessing inanimate energy. Instead of trying to survive only with his integral set of tool capabilities-his hands-to pour water into his mouth, he invents a more effective wooden, stone, or ceramic vessel so that he not only can drink from it but carry water with him and extend his hunting and berry picking. All tools are externalizations of originally integral functions. But in developing each tool man also extends the limits of its usefulness, since he can make bigger cups hold liquids too hot or chemically destructive for his hands. Tools do not introduce new principles but they greatly extend the range of conditions under which the discovered control principle may be</p>

                <p>effectively employed by man. There is nothing new in world technology’s growth. It is only the vast increase of its effective ranges that are startling man. The computer is an imitation human brain. There is nothing new about it, but its capacity, speed of operation, and tirelessness, as well as its ability to operate under environmental conditions intolerable to the human anatomy, make it far more effective in performing special tasks than is the skull and tissue encased human brain, minus the computer.</p>
                <p>What is really unique about man is the magnitude to which he has detached, deployed, amplified, and made more incisive all of his many organic functionings. Man is unique among all the living phenomena as the most adaptable omni-environment penetrating, exploring, and operating organism being initially equipped to invent intellectually and self-disciplined, dexterously, to make the tools with which thus to extend himself. The bird, the fish, the tree are all specialized, and their special capability-functioning tools are attached integrally with their bodies, making them incapable of penetrating hostile environments. Man externalizes, separates out, and increases each of his specialized function capabilities by inventing tools as soon as he discovers the need through oft-repeated experiences with</p>

                <p>unfriendly environmental challenges. Thus, man only temporarily employs his integral equipment as a specialist, and soon shifts that function to detached tools. Man cannot compete physically as a muscle and brained automaton ‹as a machine-against the automated power tools which he can invent while metaphysically mastering the energy income from universe with which evermore powerfully to actuate these evermore precise mass-production tools. What man has done is to decentralize his functions into a world-around-energy-networked complex of tools which altogether constitute what we refer to as world industrialization.</p>

                <p>Thus man has developed an externalized metabolic regeneration organism involving the whole of Spaceship Earth and all its resources. Any human being can physically employ that organism, whereas only one human can employ the organically integral craft tool. All 9I of the 92 chemical elements thus far found aboard our spaceship are completely involved in the world-around industrial network. The full family of chemical elements is unevenly distributed, and therefore our total planet is at all times involved in the industrial integration of the unique physical behaviors of each of all the elements. Paradoxically, at the present moment our Spaceship Earth is in the perilous condition of having the Russians sitting at one set of the co-pilot’s flying controls while the Americans sit at the other. France controls the starboard engines, and the Chinese control the port engines, while the United Nations controls the passenger operation. The result is an increasing number of U. F. O. hallucinations of sovereign states darting backwards and forwards and around in circles, getting nowhere, at an incredibly accelerating rate of speed. All of humanity’s tool extensions are divisible into two main groups: the craft and the industrial tools. I define the craft tools as</p>
            </page>
            <page style="text">
                <p>all those tools which could be invented by one man starting all alone, naked in the wilderness, using only his own experience and his own integral facilities. Under these isolated conditions he could and did invent spears, slings, bows, and arrows, etc. By industrial tools I mean all the tools that cannot be produced by one man, as for instance the S.S. Queen Mary. With this definition, we find that the spoken word, which took a minimum of two humans to develop, was the first industrial tool. It brought about the progressive integration of all individual generation-to-generation experiences and thoughts of all humanity everywhere and everywhen. The Bible says, "In the beginning was the word"; I say to you, "In the beginning of industrialization was the spoken word." With the graphic writing of the words and ideas we have the beginning of the computer, for the computer stores and retrieves information. The written word, dictionary and the book were the first information storing and retrieving systems.</p>
                <p>The craft tools are used initially by man to make the first industrial tools. Man is using his hands today most informatively and expertly only to press the buttons that set in action the</p>

                <p>further action of the tools which reproduce other tools which may be used informatively to make other tools. In the craft economies craftsman artists make only end- or consumer-products. In the industrial economy the craftsman artists make the tools and the tools make the end- or consumer-products. In this industrial development the mechanical advantages of men are pyramided rapidly and synergetically into invisible magnitudes of ever more incisive and inclusive tooling which produces ever more with ever less resource investment per each unit of end-product, or service, performance.</p>
                <p>As we study industrialization, we see that we cannot have mass production unless we have mass consumption. This was effected evolutionarily by the great social struggles of labor to increase wages and spread the benefits and prevent the reduction of the numbers of workers employed. The labor movement made possible mass purchasing; ergo, mass production; ergo, low prices on vastly improved products and services, which have altogether established entirely new and higher standards of humanity’s living.</p>
                <p>Our labor world and all salaried workers, including school teachers and college professors, are now, at least subconsciously if not consciously, afraid that automation will take away their jobs. They are afraid they won’t be able</p>

            <page style="text">
                <p>to do what is called "earning a living," which is short for earning the right to live. This term implies that normally we are supposed to die prematurely and that it is abnormal to be able to earn a living. It is paradoxical that only the abnormal or exceptional are entitled to prosper. Yesterday the term even inferred that success was so very abnormal that only divinely ordained kings and nobles were entitled to eat fairly regularly.</p>
                <p>It is easy to demonstrate to those who will take the time and the trouble to unbias their thoughts that automation swiftly can multiply the physical energy part of wealth much more rapidly and profusely than can man’s muscle and brain-reflexed-manually-controlled production. On the other hand humans alone can foresee, integrate, and anticipate the new tasks to be done by the progressively automated wealth-producing machinery. To take advantage of the fabulous magnitudes of real wealth waiting to be employed intelligently by humans and unblock automation’s postponement by organized labor we must give each human who is or becomes unemployed a life fellowship in research and development or in just simple thinking. Man must be able to dare to think truthfully and to act</p>

                <p>accordingly without fear of losing his franchise to live. The use of mind fellowships will permit humans comprehensively to expand and accelerate scientific exploration and experimental prototype development. For every 100,OOO employed in research and development, or just plain thinking, one probably will make a breakthrough that will more than pay for the other 99,999 fellowships. Thus, production will no longer be impeded by humans trying to do what machines can do better. Contrariwise, omni-automated and inanimately powered production will unleash humanity’s unique capability-its metaphysical capability. Historically speaking, these steps will be taken within the next decade. There is no doubt about it. But not without much social crisis and consequent educational experience and discovery concerning the nature of our unlimited wealth.</p>
                <p>Through the universal research and development fellowships, we’re going to start emancipating humanity from being muscle and reflex machines. We’re going to give everybody a chance to develop their most powerful mental and intuitive faculties. Given their research and development fellowship, many who have been frustrated during their younger years may feel like going fishing. Fishing provides an excellent opportunity to think clearly; to review one’s life; to recall one’s earlier frustrated and abandoned longings and curiosities. What</p>

                <p>We soon will begin to generate wealth so rapidly that we can do very great things. I would like you to think what this may do realistically for living without spoiling the landscape, or the antiquities or the trails of humanity throughout the ages, or despoiling the integrity of romance, vision, and harmonic creativity. All the great office buildings will be emptied of earned living workers, and the automated office-processing of information will be centralized in the basements of a few buildings. This will permit all the modernly mechanized office buildings to be used as dwelling facilities.</p>
                <p>When we approach our problems on a universal, general systems basis and progressively eliminate the irrelevancies, somewhat as we peel petals from an artichoke, at each move we leave in full visibility the next most important layer of factors with which we must deal. We gradually uncover you and me in the heart of now. But evolution requires that we comprehend each layer in order to unpeel it. We have now updated our definitions of universe by conforming them with the most recent and erudite scientific findings such as -those of Einstein and Planck.</p>

Only thus can man put to orderly advantage the various, local, and otherwise disorderly behaviors of the entropic, physical universe. Man can and may metaphysically comprehend, anticipate, shunt, and meteringly introduce the evolutionarily organized environment events in the magnitudes and frequencies that best synchronize with the patterns of his successful and metaphysical metabolic regeneration while ever increasing the degrees of humanity’s space and time freedoms from yesterday’s ignorance sustaining survival procedure chores and their personal time capital wasting.</p>

                <p>and humanity at ever more effective standards of vital physical energy and reinspiring metaphysical sustenance to be sustained exclusively on our Sun radiation’s and Moon pull gravity’s tidal, wind, and rainfall generated pulsating and therefore harnessable energies. The daily income energies are excessively adequate for the operation of our main industrial engines and their automated productions. The energy expended in one minute of a tropical hurricane equals the combined energy of all the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. nuclear weapons. Only by understanding this scheme may we continue for all time ahead to enjoy and explore universe as we progressively harness evermore of the celestially generated tidal and storm generated wind, water, and electrical power concentrations. We cannot afford to expend our fossil fuels faster than we are "recharging our battery," which means precisely the rate at which the fossil fuels are being continually deposited within Earth’s spherical crust.</p>
                <p>We have discovered that it is highly feasible for all the human passengers aboard Spaceship Earth to enjoy the whole ship without any individual interfering with another and without any individual being advantaged at the expense of another, provided that we are not so foolish as to burn up our ship and its</p>

                <p>operating equipment by powering our prime operations exclusively on atomic reactor generated energy. The too-shortsighted and debilitating exploitation of fossil fuels and atomic energy are similar to running our automobiles only on the self-starters and batteries and as the latter become exhausted replenishing the batteries only by starting the chain reaction consumption of the atoms with which the automobiles are constituted.</p>
                <p>We have discovered also why we were given our intellectual faculties and physical extension facilities. We have discovered that we have the inherent capability and inferentially the responsibility of making humanity comprehensively and sustainably successful. We have learned the difference between brain and mind capabilities. We have learned of the superstitions and inferiority complexes built into all humanity through all of history’s yesterdays of slavish survival under conditions of abysmal illiteracy and ignorance wherein only the most ruthless, shrewd, and eventually brutish could sustain existence, and then for no more than a third of its known potential life span.</p>
                <p>This all brings us to a realization of the enormous educational task which must be successfully accomplished right now in a hurry in order to convert man’s spin-dive toward oblivion into an intellectually mastered power pullout into safe and level</p>

If it comprehends and reacts effectively, humanity will open an entirely new chapter of the experiences and the thoughts and drives thereby stimulated.</p>
                <p>Most importantly we have learned that from here on it is success for all or for none, for it is experimentally proven by physics that "unity is plural and at minimum two"‹the complementary but not mirror-imaged proton and neutron. You and I are inherently different and complementary. Together we average as zero-that is, as eternity.</p>
                <p>Now having attained that cosmic degree of orbital conceptioning we will use our retrorocket controls to negotiate our reentry of our Spaceship Earth’s atmosphere and return to our omni-befuddled present. Here we find ourselves maintaining the fiction that our crossbreeding World Man consists fundamentally of innately different nations and races which are the antithesis of that crossbreeding. Nations are products of many generations of local in-breeding in a myriad of remote human enclaves. With grandfather chiefs often marrying incestuously the gene concentrations brought about hybrid nationally-unique physiological characteristics which in the extreme northern hibernations bleached out the human skin and in the equatorial</p>
